EuroHPC JU Systems
-------
The EuroHPC Joint Undertaking allows the EU and EuroHPC participating countries to coordinate their efforts and pool their resources with the objective of deploying in Europe world-class exascale supercomputers, able to perform more than one trillion (1.0e+18) operations per second and developing innovative supercomputing technologies and applications. See `EuroHPC JU page <https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/discover-eurohpc#ecl-inpage-211>`_

EuroHPC JU is developing a world-class supercomputing infrastructure by procuring and deploying by 2021 in the EU three pre-exascale supercomputers (capable of at least 1.0e+17 calculations per second) and five petascale supercomputers (capable of at least 1.0e+15 calculations per second). These new machines are being located across the European Union and will be available to Europe's private and public users, scientific and industrial users everywhere in Europe.
